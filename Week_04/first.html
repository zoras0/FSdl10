    <p class="middle-text"> (黒島 伝治, 1898–1943) Denji (デンジ?) is the titular protagonist of the Chainsaw Man manga and anime series. He is the main protagonist of the Public Safety Saga and the co-protagonist of the Academy Saga.
As a young boy, he inherits his father's debts from the Yakuza. After meeting Pochita, he becomes a Devil Hunter for the Yakuza in an attempt to clear his debt. Once the Yakuza, under the control of a Devil, betrays him, he dies and Pochita becomes his heart. He is then revived and can become the Chainsaw Man (チェンソーマン Chensō Man?) by pulling a cord on his chest. After meeting Makima, he became a Public Safety Devil Hunter as a member of Tokyo Special Division 4.</p>

    <p1>"How old am I?" With a heart full of determination and a head full of wild dreams, he sets off on an epic quest to uncover the truth of his age!
        As Kaito traverses the mystical lands of Anime-Topia, he encounters a wise old sage, who speaks in riddles and rhymes. "To find your age, young warrior, you must first count the stars in the sky, then divide by the number of times you’ve cried!" Kaito scratches his head, pondering the sage's cryptic words.
        Next, he meets a quirky cat-girl named Neko-chan, who insists that age is just a number, but only if you can defeat her in a dance-off! With every twirl and spin, Kaito realizes that the true essence of age lies not in numbers but in the memories he creates along the way.</p1>
